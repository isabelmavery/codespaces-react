### Implementation Details

#### Client Folder Structure:

```
/pages
```

- Wrappers for each primary tab or page on the website

```
/base-components
```

- The home for widely re-usable, simple react components (anchor, button)

```
/components
```

- The home for largely specific, context based react components (coffee shop, game )

```
/hooks
```

- For custom react hooks

```
/sounds
```

- For any audio files

</br>

### Some To Dos:

- [ ] add animation when you click play on music plus different options
- [ ] extend game to have points / barriers
- [ ] add dates to resume in --pretty-purple
- [ ] potentially put all tabs on one page
