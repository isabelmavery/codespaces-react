                Hey! My name is Isabel, and I've been working as a fullstack software engineer for the past ~ five years now.
                I've loved getting to build products from scratch with some wonderful teams over the past few years.

                I am from the chicago area originally (Evanston) and love a lot of things outside of work, though they seem to change from month to month. 
                Right now I'm very into yoga, Chappel Roan and Neil Gaimen but that could change by March :)
